                Nebula is an automated software company that is growing in the streetwear fashion and
                sneaker space. It allows its users to automate the checkout process to purchase items and increase their
                chances on
                successfully obtaining limited shoes, clothing, accessories, and other highly sought-after items. These
                items can be sold for an after-market price that allows the owner to gain profit margins that may seem
                other-worldly to the average person.

                This project was a commercial project that I was personally hired to do. The purpose was to give their
                current UI a refreshing update and feature a number of new updates that would be coming to the software.

                <p class="goal-p">This project had one goal: make a lasting impression on Cybersole's nearly 100,000
                    followers and general audience. The animation itself draws inspiration from a popular style called
                    "Kinetic Typography," which involves meaningful cuts and motion that utilize the soundtrack to
                    enhance the visuals of the animation itself.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="goal-p">
                    This was a big opportunity not only for myself but for the company to make an everlasting
                    impression in the community and audience that were intended to watch. I pulled inspiration from
                    Apple, Google, and Microsoft to study and see well-done, perfectly
                    executed, and marketable animations or videos.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="goal-p">
                    What exactly makes up a successful ad or marketing animation? Is it the animation style? Is it the
                    color scheme that's carefully chosen and kept uniform throughout? Or maybe it's a little of
                    everything. This is something Cybersole and I wanted. Something that just looked and felt right.
                    This took hours upon hours looking at examples, trial and error, and suggestions.
