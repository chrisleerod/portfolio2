                Kodai is an automated software company which has one of the best and consistent
                products publicly available. The software itself helps users obtain limited shoes, clothes, accessories,
                art, and more to allow them to sell, wear or keep these items. One would see the brands such as Nike's
                Off-White collaboration with Virgil Abloh, Nike's partnership with Travis Scott, Kanye West's Yeezy,
                etc. be associated with the concept of selling these items for after-market prices to gain profit.

                This project was a commercial project, and the purpose was to curate a marketing animation that showed
                their new features and dashboard and generate excitement for their user-base.

                    Kodai is a well-established, but relatively young company in the sneaker reselling space. Their
                    vision was to present a fresh animated video with depth. We chose to utilize three-dimensional
                    scenes and camera movement to give an element to the video that others typically don't have. The
                    video was to illustrate the features that their new dashboard had to offer. It involves different
                    types of graphs and information that could give limitless possibilities to animate.

                    The video's purpose and goal were to give stunning visuals while hitting the target of showing the
                    functionality of their new product. I began looking at different three-dimensional scenes and
                    designs to start visualizing what type of elements could make the video. After studying the
                    interface, I began to pick apart the design and decide what could be animated in specific ways to
                    enhance the project. Adobe XD's compatibility with After Effects allowed me to import the interface
                    as shape layers to avoid losing quality and to have full editability.

                    This video was arguably one of my most complex projects, and going into it I realized this. I had to
                    plan with Kodai's team beforehand to take into account what they wanted and what I think would be
                    best as the designer. There were countless hours, renditions, revisions, and discussions to create
                    this video.

                    The graph was going to be a significant point to the opening scene and the whole video. There
                    are tons of great things you can do with a chart, motion-design wise. I decided that almost
                    following the formation of the graph would be an interesting shot. Below you'll see a
                    two-dimensional view of the graph with the modals that their dashboard offers. The graph offers an
                    analytical interpretation of a user's data elegantly.

                    Now that we had a definite style choice and general direction, we went to work. I needed to curate
                    the angles, speed of the cameras, and all of the animations included in each scene. Each interface
                    would be custom animated to suit the transitions better and make each camera movement seamless.
                    Overall, the general idea was to make things belong precisely where they were.
