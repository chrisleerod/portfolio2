                Kodai is an automated software company. The software itself helps users obtain limited shoes, clothes,
                accessories,
                art, and more to allow them to sell, wear or keep these items. One would see the brands such as Nike's
                Off-White collaboration with Virgil Abloh, Nike's partnership with Travis Scott, Kanye West's Yeezy,
                etc. be associated with the concept of selling these items for after-market prices to gain profit.

                This project was a commercial project, and the purpose was to curate a marketing animation that showed
                their new features and dashboard and generate excitement for their user-base.

                    Kodai had finished development on a large update that would grant users access to a dashboard that
                    provided analytical information, software support, announcements, etc. They wanted to create a
                    project that conveyed exactly how important this update was for their software.

                <p class="goal-p">
                    How would we create a video that gains the viewer's attention and convey the dashboard in such a way
                    that it establishes significance in their eye, whether it be someone who owns the software, or maybe
                    a potential customer? How can I show the UI's capabilities in a video? These are questions that were
                    important to consider when starting.

                    This project was a massive opportunity for Kodai to gain further support than what they already

                    The goal was to animate the interface to illustrate
                    interactiveness and demonstrate the significance and functionality it would have. Below you'll see
                    a
                    two-dimensional view of a graph that is animated in the opening scene. The graph offers an
                    analytical interpretation of a user's data.

                    The Kodai team decided that a style that featured three-dimensional scenes aligned with their vision
                    and shared it to help spring forward
                    our direction. They wanted it to feature three-dimensional camera angles, data-driven animations,
                    and continuous
                    movement. All of these were something the Kodai team wanted and needed to be in the video.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="goal-p">
                    Now that we had a definite style choice and general direction, we went to work. I needed to curate
                    the angles, speed of the cameras, and all of the animations included in each scene. Each interface
                    would be custom animated to suit the transitions better and make each camera movement seamless.
                    Overall, the general idea was to make the interface and camera movement work harmoniously.

                <p class="goal-p">
                    There were things we wanted to keep in mind, and things we wanted to change. We wanted a more fluid,
                    dynamic approach with the camera movements, but we also wanted our animations to create a sense of
                    depth
                    with three-dimensional movement.
