                Cybersole is an automated software company which is arguably one of the most successful and well-known.
                The software itself helps users obtain limited shoes, clothes, accessories,
                art, and more to allow them to sell, wear or keep these items. One would see the brands such as Nike's
                Off-White collaboration with Virgil Abloh, Nike's partnership with Travis Scott, Kanye West's Yeezy,
                etc. be associated with the concept of selling these items for after-market prices to gain profit.

                This project was a commercial project, and the purpose was to curate a marketing animation that showed
                their new features along with unveiling a ground-breaking companion app that allowed remote access to
                their software.

                    followers and general audience. The animation itself draws inspiration from a popular style called
                    "Kinetic Typography," which involves meaningful cuts and motion that utilize the soundtrack to
                    enhance the visuals of the animation itself.

                    This project was a big opportunity not only for myself but for the company to make an everlasting
                    impression in the community and audience that were intended to watch. I pulled inspiration from
                    Apple, Google, and Microsoft to study and see well-done, perfectly
                    executed, and marketable animations or videos.
